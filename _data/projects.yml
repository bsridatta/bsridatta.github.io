    Real time accident detection in video feeds using Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM cells. Trained on hand sampled clips from YouTube. Part of my bachelor thesis.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Built a deep learning model to detect car accidents in video clips
    --Implemented and tweaked YOLOv2 to detect cars in highway cams
    --Wrote scripts to scrape video clips from Youtube
    --Collected a data set of 200+ accident/non-accident videos
    --Preprocessed the data-set to lessen the burden on the machine
    --Explored pre trained models on the internet with the gathered videos
    --Experimented with a few DL models for classification
    --Implemented HRNN with LSTM to classify the video clips

    Python, Keras, Google Colabs
