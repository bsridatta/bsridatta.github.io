    In the spirit to get involved in Deep Learing and Computer Vision, 
    I moved far away from my home to Sweden to study at KTH. Having planned my 2 years with many intersting courses and projects, I wish to equip myself with amples skills and expertise to

    I started my bachelors with a huge goal to score high GPA and was placed in the top 3 of the department by the end of first semester. I then realised that was not really what I want. Thanks to all the faculty who motivated me to go beyond academics. I began then and never stopped.
    I invest humongous amount of time experimenting with literally everything I could get my hands on. Have a look at the projects I talk about in the following sections.
     Besides that I also took active part in Maths Club and the Toastmasters.
